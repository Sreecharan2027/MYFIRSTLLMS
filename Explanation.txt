#model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
The model used is  is part of the sentence-transformers library, which is designed for tasks involving sentence or text embeddings. 
The model specified, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, is a pre-trained model optimized for generating embeddings of sentences, which can be used 
for various natural language processing tasks such as semantic search, clustering, and paraphrase mining.

Breakdown of all-MiniLM-L6-v2:
    MiniLM: A lightweight model based on Microsoft's MiniLM architecture, which is designed to be efficient while maintaining high performance in language tasks.
    L6: Indicates that this model has 6 layers, which is relatively shallow compared to larger models like BERT.
    v2: Indicates the version of this specific model, with updates and improvements over earlier versions.



Vectorization in the context of natural language processing (NLP) refers to the process of converting text data into numerical 
representations (vectors) that can be processed by machine learning algorithms. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the
text in a numerical form.



This function is designed to convert a list of text chunks into their corresponding vector representations using a given model.
#vectorizing text chunks
    def vectorize_text_chunks(text_chunks, model):
    vectors = [model.encode(chunk) for chunk in text_chunks]
    return np.array(vectors)


This function converts a single query string into its vector representation using a given model.
#query vectorization
    def vectorize_query(query, model):
    return model.encode([query])


The MultiClassConversationalAgent1 class is designed to function as a conversational agent capable of handling multiple classes of data. 
It enables adding data for different classes, searching within those classes, and retrieving relevant text chunks based on queries.
