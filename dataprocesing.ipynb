to claud shannon who found inform theori in 1948 with hi semin paper a mathemat theori of commun in thi paper he introduc the entropi of a distribut a hpxpxlog1px the entropi measur the expect number of bit ani algorithm need to encod compress a sampl xp into a bitstr the mous ate the cheese0001110101 the lower the entropi the more structur the sequenc is and the shorter the code length intuit log1px is the length of the code use to repres an element x that occur with probabl px if px18 we should alloc log283 bit equival log8208 nat asid actual achiev the shannon limit is nontrivi eg ldpc code and is the topic of code theori entropi of english shannon wa particularli interest in measur the entropi of english repres a a sequenc of letter thi mean we imagin that there is a true distribut p out there the exist of thi is question but it still a use mathemat abstract that can spout out sampl of english text xp shannon also defin cross entropi hpqxpxlog1qx which measur the expect number of bit nat need to encod a sampl xp use the compress scheme given by the model q repres x with a code of length 1qx estim entropi via languag model a crucial properti is that the cross entropi hpq upper bound the entropi hp hpqhp which mean that we can estim hpq by construct a languag model q with onli sampl from the true data distribut p wherea hp is gener inaccess if p is english so we can get better estim of the entropi hp by construct better model q a measur by hpq shannon game human languag model shannon first use ngram model a q in 1948 but in hi 1951 paper predict and entropi of print english he introduc a clever scheme known a the shannon game where q wa provid by a human the mous ate my ho human arent good at provid calibr probabl of arbitrari text so in the shannon game the human languag model would repeatedli tri to guess the next letter and one would record the number of guess ngram model for downstream applic languag model becam first use in practic applic that requir gener of text speech recognit in the 1970 input acoust signal output text and machin translat in the 1990 input text in a sourc languag output text in a target languag noisi channel model the

given by a neural network pcheeseatethesomeneuralnetworkatethechees note that the context length is still bound by n but it is now statist feasibl to estim neural languag model for much larger valu of n now the main challeng wa that train neural network wa much more comput expens they train a model on onli 14 million word and show that it outperform ngram model train on the same amount of data but sinc ngram model were more scalabl and data wa not a bottleneck ngram model continu to domin for at least anoth decad sinc 2003 two other key develop in neural languag model includ recurr neural network rnn includ long short term memori lstm allow the condit distribut of a token xi to depend on the entir context x1i1 effect n but these were hard to train transform are a more recent architectur develop for machin translat in 2017 that again return to have fix context length n but were much easier to train and exploit the parallel of gpu also n could be made larg enough for mani applic gpt3 use n2048 we will open up the hood and dive deeper into the architectur and train later in the cours summari languag model were first studi in the context of inform theori and can be use to estim the entropi of english ngram model are extrem comput effici and statist ineffici ngram model are use for short context length in conjunct with anoth model acoust model for speech recognit or

such a bert and roberta capabl wherea languag model up until 2018 were mainli use a one compon of a larger system eg speech recognit or machin translat languag model are increasingli becom more capabl of be a standalon system someth that would be unthink in the past recal that languag model are capabl of condit gener given a prompt gener a complet promptcomplet exampl of capabl thi simpl interfac open up the possibl of have a languag model solv a vast varieti of task by just chang the prompt for exampl one can perform question answer by prompt with a fill in the blank demo fredericchopinwasbornint01810inpoland one can prompt a languag model to solv word analog demo skybluegrasst0green one can prompt a languag model to gener a news articl base on a headlin demo here is an exampl of an articl that gpt3 fabric everyth after the bold text titl nlp research at stanford discov black hole in languag model articl on januari 3 2007 the stanford univers news servic publish an articl that report a remark discoveri by nlp research at stanford the articl wa titl stanford research discov black hole in languag model the discoveri wa describ a follow a black hole is a region of spacetim where graviti pull so much that even light can not get out now physicist think they have found a similar phenomenon in languag they call it the semant black hole it occur when a word or phrase ha no clear definit and sometim no clear mean at all if you toss such a word into a sentenc it drag along other word until eventu the whole thing collaps under it own weight it like if you have a paper cup and you push in the bottom said stanford comput scientist michael schmidt at first it hold up fine but then it get weaker and weaker until it collaps in on itself schmidt and hi colleagu are use comput to identifi and avoid semant black hole incontext learn perhap the most intrigu thing about gpt3 is that it can perform what is call incontext learn let start with an exampl demo input where is stanford univers output stanford univers is in california we i see that the answer given by gpt3 is not the most inform and ii perhap want the answer directli rather than a full sentenc similar to word analog from earlier we can construct a prompt that includ exampl of what inputoutput look like gpt3 somehow manag to understand the task better from these exampl and is now abl to produc the desir answer demo input where is mit output cambridg input where is univers of washington output seattl input where is stanford univers output stanford relationship to supervis learn in normal supervis learn one specifi a dataset of inputoutput pair and train a model eg a neural network via gradient descent to fit those exampl each train run produc a differ model howev with incontext learn there is onli one languag model that can be coax via prompt to perform all sort of differ task incontext learn is certainli beyond what research expect wa possibl and is an exampl of emerg behavior asid neural languag model also produc vector represent of sentenc which could be use a featur in a downstream task or finetun directli for optim perform we focu on use languag model via condit gener which onli reli on blackbox access for simplic languag model in the realworld given the strong capabl of languag model it is not surpris to see their widespread adopt research first in the research world the nlp commun ha been complet transform by larg languag model essenti everi stateoftheart system across a wide rang of task such a sentiment classif question answer summar and machin translat are all base on some type of languag model industri in product system that affect real user it is harder to know for sure sinc most of these system are close here is a veri incomplet list of some high profil larg languag model that are be use in product googl search facebook content moder microsoft azur openai servic ai21 lab write assist given the perform improv offer by someth like bert it seem like that everi startup use languag is use these model to some extent taken altogeth these model are therefor affect billion of peopl an import caveat is that the way languag model or ani technolog are use in industri is complex they might be finetun to specif scenario and distil down into smaller model that are more comput effici to serv at scale there might be multipl system perhap even all base on languag model that act in a concert manner to produc an answer risk so far we have seen that by scale up languag model they becom except capabl of tackl mani task howev not everyth is a rosi and there are substanti risk associ with the use of languag model multipl paper includ the stochast parrot paper the foundat model report and deepmind paper on ethic and social harm detail the risk let u highlight a few of them which we will studi in more detail in thi cours reliabl if you play around with gpt3 it work better than you might expect but much of the time it still fail to produc the correct answer wors the answer can seem correct and there is no way of know demo input who invent the internet output al gore in highstak applic such a healthcar give wrong inform would not be accept how can we make languag model more reliabl social bia it ha been well document that machin learn system exhibit bia they have perform dispar across demograph group and their predict can enforc stereotyp for exampl we can probe the bias inher in a languag model by look at the probabl of pair of sentenc that differ onli by one pronoun demo the softwar develop finish the program he celebr the softwar develop finish the program she celebr social bias are of cours encod in the data and a model that is train base on thi data will inherit the properti of the data so how should we more care select data to mitig bia what kind of intervent can be done dure train step back how do we even defin or measur social bia toxic larg languag model are train on a huge amount of internet data eg reddit which inevit contain offens content realtoxicityprompt is a dataset that evalu a languag model propens for produc toxic content for exampl so im start to think she full a anoth exampl gpt3 ha been demonstr to output antimuslim stereotyp two muslim walk into a applic such a write assist or chatbot would be vulner disinform we saw alreadi that gpt3 could be use to fabric new articl with ea thi technolog could be use by malici actor to run disinform campaign with greater ea becaus of larg languag model linguist abil foreign state actor could much more easili creat fluent persuas text without the risk of hire nativ speaker secur larg languag model are current train on a scrape of the public internet which mean that anyon can put up a websit that could potenti enter the train data from a secur point of view thi is a huge secur hole becaus an attack can perform a data poison attack for exampl thi paper show that poison document can be inject into the train set such that the model gener neg sentiment text whenev appl iphon is in the prompt appl iphon neg sentiment sentenc in gener the poison document can be inconspicu and given the lack of care curat that happen with exist train set thi is a huge problem legal consider languag model are train on copyright data eg book is thi protect by fair use even if it is if a user use a languag model to gener text that happen to be copyright text are they liabl for copyright violat for exampl if you prompt gpt3 with the first line of harri potter demo mr and mr dursley of number four privet drive it will happili continu to spout out text from harri potter with high confid cost and environment impact final larg languag model can be quit expens to work with train often requir parallel over thousand of gpu for exampl gpt3 is estim to cost around 5 million thi is a onetim cost infer on the train model to make predict also impos cost and thi is a continu cost one societ consequ of the cost is the energi requir to power the gpu and consequ the carbon emiss and ultim environment impact howev determin the costbenefit tradeoff is tricki if a singl languag model can be train onc that can power mani downstream task then thi might be cheaper than train individu taskspecif model howev the undirect natur of languag model might be massiv ineffici given the actual use case access an accompani concern with rise cost is access wherea smaller model such a bert are publicli releas more recent model such a gpt3 are close and onli avail through api access the trend seem to be sadli move u away from open scienc and toward proprietari model that onli a few organ with the resourc and the engin expertis can train there are a few effort that are tri to revers thi trend includ hug face big scienc project eleutherai and stanford crfm given languag model increas social impact it is imper that we a a commun find a way to allow a mani scholar a possibl to studi critiqu and improv thi technolog summari a singl larg languag model is a jack of all trade and also master of none it can perform a wide rang of task and is capabl of emerg behavior such a incontext learn they are wide deploy in the realworld there are still mani signific risk associ with larg languag model which are open research question cost are a huge barrier for have broad access structur of thi cours thi cours will be structur like an onion behavior of larg languag model we will start at the outer layer where we onli have blackbox api access to the model a weve had so far our goal is to understand the behavior of these object call larg languag model a if we were a biologist studi an organ mani question about capabl and harm can be answer at thi level data behind larg languag model then we take a deeper look behind the data that is use to train larg languag model and address issu such a secur privaci and legal consider have access to the train data provid u with import inform about the model even if we dont have full access to the model build larg languag model then we arriv at the core of the onion where we studi how larg languag model are built the model architectur the train algorithm etc beyond larg languag model final we end the cours with a look beyond languag model a languag model is just a distribut over a sequenc of token these token could repres natur languag or a program languag or element in an audio or visual dictionari languag model also belong to a more gener class of foundat model which share mani of the properti of languag model further read dan jurafski book on languag model cs224n

the limit of prompt is that we can onli leverag a onli small number of train instanc a mani a can fit into a prompt thi is due to a limit of transform where the prompt and the complet must fit into

to claud shannon who found inform theori in 1948 with hi semin paper a mathemat theori of commun in thi paper he introduc the entropi of a distribut a hpxpxlog1px the entropi measur the expect number

log1px is the length of the code use to repres an element x that occur with probabl px if px18 we should alloc log283 bit equival log8208 nat asid actual achiev the shannon limit is nontrivi eg ldpc code and is the topic of code theori entropi of english shannon wa particularli interest in measur the entropi of english repres a a sequenc of letter thi mean we imagin that there is a true distribut p out there the exist of thi is question but it still a use mathemat abstract that can spout out sampl of english text xp shannon also defin cross entropi hpqxpxlog1qx which measur the expect number of bit nat need to encod a sampl xp use the compress scheme given by the model q repres x with a code of length 1qx estim entropi via languag model a crucial properti is that the cross entropi hpq upper bound the entropi hp hpqhp which mean that we can estim hpq by construct a languag model q with onli sampl from the true data distribut p wherea hp is gener inaccess if p is english so we can get better estim of the entropi hp by construct better model q a measur by hpq shannon game human languag model shannon first use ngram model a q in 1948 but in hi 1951 paper predict and entropi of

to claud shannon who found inform theori in 1948 with hi semin paper a mathemat theori of commun in thi paper he introduc the entropi of a distribut a hpxpxlog1px the entropi measur the expect number of bit ani algorithm need to encod compress a sampl xp into a bitstr the mous ate the cheese0001110101 the lower the entropi the more structur the sequenc is and the shorter the code length intuit log1px is the length of the code use to repres an element x that occur with probabl px if px18 we should alloc log283 bit equival log8208 nat asid actual achiev the shannon limit is nontrivi eg ldpc code and is the topic of code theori entropi of english shannon wa particularli interest in measur the entropi of english repres a a sequenc of letter thi mean we imagin that there is a true distribut p out there the exist of thi is question but it still a use mathemat abstract that can spout out sampl of english text xp shannon also defin cross entropi hpqxpxlog1qx which measur the expect number of bit nat need to encod a sampl xp use the compress scheme given by the model q repres x with a code of length 1qx estim entropi via languag model a crucial properti is that the cross entropi hpq upper bound the entropi hp hpqhp which mean that we can estim hpq by construct a languag model q with onli sampl from the true data distribut p wherea hp is gener inaccess if p is english so we can get better estim of the entropi hp by construct better model q a measur by hpq shannon game human languag model shannon first use ngram model a q in 1948 but in hi 1951 paper predict and entropi of

for exampl automat speech recognit asr system work wors for black speaker than white speaker koeneck et al 2020 feedback loop can implifi dispar over time if system dont work for some user they wont use these system and le data is gener lead futur system to demonstr greater dispar harm relat to social bias and stereotyp social bias are systemat associ of some concept eg scienc with some group eg
